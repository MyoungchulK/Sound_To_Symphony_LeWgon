# ðŸ“š Sound to Symphony (AI Music Generation)

- Under cleaning at this point. Pls bare with me until I finish mopping.
- Generates completely new music by Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can be easily customizable by musical software
- Architectures RNN model for learning musica lpatterns from large classical music datasets that are expressed in numerical format.
- Deplyed the project into the Streamlit by utilizing FastAPI
- Built the connection between generated music and musical software Abelton
